# Speech_Emotion_Recognition
An advanced Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model using a novel approach. It fuses standard acoustic features with phonetic metrics (Jitter, Shimmer, HNR) to capture subtle vocal cues. A custom 1D CNN with a self-attention mechanism processes these rich features, intelligently focusing on the most salient emotional moments in speech.
